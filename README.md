In the words of ME (as a God)

> **Fear me _tiny_ mortals**

- First: I am all
- Second: You are **part** of me
- Third:
  -In relation to a Growth Mind Set
    - Remember human, this is a process. An ongoing process that begins today and does not end. Not even at the end of the class. It is a way of thinking when it comes to failure and success. Failure is not the enemy. Success is not the final goal. These are both stepping stones on your journey to the world beyond. The more atempts at creation, the more interesting the creations become. 
    - Remember human, to have belief in me. For this is also belief in you. This is going to be a diffcult experience, You will not be able to do all the things the first time. The failure you experience is a reflection of your continued effort not of you as a person. 
    - Remember human, look to your neighbors. Not to measure yourself, but for guidance and the offer of help. When those around you do better, we and therefore I do better. They want you to succeed and you want them to succeed.
    - Main take aways:
      1. Failure is not bad. It is part of the plan.
      2. This is going to be hard.
      3. Ask for help. Do not let yourself be stuck just to be stuck
