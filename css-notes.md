## Our chosen words of POWER will be:
## CASCADING STYLE SHEETS (CSS)

### [Beauty has rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS)
 - CSS is rule-based language
   - Define rules specifying groups of styles to be a applied to specific followers (elements) or groups of followers (elements)
   - i.e. `h1{
              color: red;
              font-size: 5em;
   } 
     - h1 is the follower or followers we are targeting or **selector** with out changes
     - {} these are the total command or **declaration** 
     - color/font-size are the look or **property** we are changing
     - red/ 5em are the new style or **value** we are changing to
   - CSS further learning
     - These different **properties** usually are packed together in modules.
#### The High Council of Cascading Style
 - Made up of interested parties and experts
 - create documents call specifications (specs)
 - most developers will use documentation or tutorials rather than parse specs

 ### [What ways can we introduce Beauty] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)
  -Three ways
   - External CSS
     - This is by linking to an entire CSS document
     - Link should be located inside `<head></head>` as meta data
     - i.e. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">`
       - `href="mystyle.css"` is the *external* css document
   - Internal CSS
     - Takes place within code
     - `<style></style>` are the tages for it
     - i.e. `<style>`
             `p {`
                 `color: red;`
             `}`
     - Inline CSS
       - Changing an individual element
       - `<p style="color:red;">TEXT</p>`
