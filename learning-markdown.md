Oh mighty lord, how does one use the language of Markdown? I too wish to learn how to conrtol the ether.
  - __I see little one. What do you know already?__

You have answered my prayers. I already know how to type and access webpages
  - __Goooood, mmm. For Markdown, you must know that this is does not require coding per se. Some of its tricks and tasks my stay hidden to you. Is this okay?__

Aye lord, I am just looking for an easy way to disscuss code and be able to quickly publish.
  - __Then you have done well to choose Markdown. When you use Markdown through Github there are several ways you can manipulate what others see. Be aware that what you see is not what the end user sees.__

Is there ways for me to know what the end user would be seeing? Is there a blessed format?
  - __There be. The most basic is how to twist words.__
  - __To speak with the power of God (Bold) `__chosen words__`__
  - ***To elicit pain of word (Italics) `_chosen words_`***
