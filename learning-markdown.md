# WHO CRIES OUT OVER THE ETHER

Oh mighty lord, how does one use the language of Markdown? I too wish to learn how to conrtol the ether.
  - __I see little one. What do you know already?__

You have answered my prayers. I already know how to type and access webpages
  - __Goooood, mmm. For Markdown, you must know that this is does not require coding per se. Some of its tricks and tasks my stay hidden to you. Is this okay?__

Aye lord, I am just looking for an easy way to disscuss code and be able to quickly publish.
  - __Then you have done well to choose Markdown. When you use Markdown through Github there are several ways you can manipulate what others see. Be aware that what you see is not what the end user sees.__

Is there ways for me to know what the end user would be seeing? Is there a blessed format?
  - __There be. The most basic is how to twist words.__
  - __To speak with the power of God (Bold) `__chosen words__`__
  - ***To elicit pain of word (Italics) `_chosen words_`***
  - __~~To place words directly in to minds (Strikethrough) `~~chosen words~~`~~__
  - __To speak of my words (Quote) `> chosen words`__
  - __To be able to list my commandmants (Ordered List) `1. Chosen word 2.Chosen Words`__
  - __To pontificate in series (Unordered List) `-/* chosen words -/* chosen words`__
  - __To derive the minutiae of My Theology (Nested List) `- chosen words`__
    - __You must go deeper                                    `- chosen words`__
      - __You must go even deeper within yourself__
  - __If you wish to connect to a specific piece of scripture (Creating Link) `[Chosen word](location of item)`__
  - __If you are looking to damn or bless a specific person (Mentions) `@username`__

Thine Grace be done, you have gifted me with immense knowledge. I will work with it again and again until it becomes second nature. Is there more to learn after this, oh wise one?
  - __Always my young disciple. Maintain the Growth Mindset. Learning is forever.__
