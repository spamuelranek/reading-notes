### [INDIAN ISLAND HAND WRITING (JavaScript)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
 - This is for the more esoteric of us
    - JavaScript is a protype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
      - Even Those On High only have a glancing blow of an idea of what that means

#### [The varieties of coffee Rx (Variables in JavaScript)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
 - Variables are containers for storing data (values)
 - `var x = 5;`
 - `var x = x + 5;`
 - `var sandwich = "Polo";`
 - `var explore = fish + sandwich`
   - There are rules to what can and cant be a variable
    - Each variable has to be unique
    - Must be a letter, number, underscore, or dollar sign
    - Has to start with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore
 - Once declared variables can be called upon any where in the code
 - Variables can also use operators
    - `var x = 5 + 2 + 4`
     - `x = 10`
    - `var x = "John" + " " + "Doe"`
     - `x = John Doe`
