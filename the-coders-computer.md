# The Coder's Computer

## __THIS BE THE WAY TO HAVE A COMPUTER SETUP AS SPOKEN BY THEY WHO BE UPON HIGH__

### __Remember these are guidelines. They will adapt and change as you find your needs change depend on what you are doing__

#### __but to deviate to far will inevitably lead to inefficiency and possibly death__

1. Knoweth whether you use a text editor or a code editor
2. A text editor can be a good tool for simple tasks and usuasally will come with you divine machine
3. For thine editor text or code, thou should be working in plain text. Formating should come from your inputs not on the code itself
4. If you have seen the wisdom to maniuplate the ether with a code editor there are some things you should think about:
 - Code Completion
   - This is the editor having closing syntax pieces come into existence anytime and opening is placed in your code
   - This is prompting words as you start typing them
 - Syntac Highlighting
   - This divine sight helps show the different parts of your code through a color coded means. It makes it easier to spot mistakes and just evaluate code
 - Extension Support
   - This one will become just as important as you find out how you like to manipulate the ether with code. You may find specific extensions make the walls quake and other that just break them down. Interpret at your own risk
5. VSCode is the **Language** upon high at the moment
6. One must learn to navigate the world through words alone. These be just a few:
   - `pwd` Present Working Directory/ Print Working Directory
   - `ls` List everything in that Directory
   - `mkdir` Make an new directory (File) with in the Directory
   - `cd` Change directorym it allows for selection of a Directory
   - `cd ..` Moves to the parent Directory
   - `touch` creates a file with the application selected
   - `code` opens up VS code
   - `cp` Copies selected item. will need path and file name e.i.` cp 101_test/reading.md`
   - `mv` Moves selected item. will need path and file name e.i. ` mv 101_test/reading.md`
   - `rm` Removes seleced item. will need path and file name e.i. `rm 101_test/reading.md`
7. One must learn caution when using regular words with these words of power. These words of power sees everything as a file.
8. These words of power read books to understand them instead of looking at the cover.
9. To make one invisible to the simple words of power `.` To check for invisible entities `ls -a`
