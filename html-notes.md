# HOW TO SKTCH STRCTR FOR THE ether

## Hyper Text Markup Language
  - Used for structure
  - Helps define flow through the ether
  - Not for the smoke and mirror parts of the ceremony
  - Interested in how many priests are involved

### [Skeleton (Wireframe)](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)
  - Design without robes
  - Pen and Paper and stage directions
  - It will also depend on who the audience
    - For followers might take more time
    - For other prophets maybe design is not as important. They are already converted.
  - Key ideas
    1. Clarity - we want people to know who they are worshiping
    2. Confidence - easily be able to follow all parts of the ceremony.
    3. Simplicity - too much smoke and mirrors may spook followers. Make those decisions consciously.

### [Anatomy of HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
  - Full piece is an element
    - Tags wrap at both sides
    - The material within is content
    - i.e. `<p>The chosen people</p>`
  - Some more words that will help your cermonies:
    - `<strong> </strong>` Speak with the power of the GODs
    - `<p> </p>` Have words to speak
    - `<!DOCTYPE html>` This is the opening prayer for every ceremony
    - `<img src="X">` Conjure an image
    - `<title></title>` What people call your ceremony at the top of the page
    - `<head></head>` Content that is not shown to the followers
    - `<a href="X"></a>` A link to another ceremony
    - `<ul></ul>` For random pieces in the ceremony
    - `<ol></ol>` For a step sequence in teh ceremony
      - Both of these last two will also have `<li></li>` around each item in the list
    - `<h1></h6>` Choose for how loud you wish to yell at/for the gods

### [Semantics Matter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
  - This means some code has an element to it outside just its code. It is a structure piece
    - i.e. `<h1></h1>` is semantic, in that is also means a top level heading
